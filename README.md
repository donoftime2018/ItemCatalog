# ItemCatalog
A MERN Stack I made that houses name, price, and description of items. Items can be deleted using the trash button on a specific item or added using the form on the very bottom of the page. To run the program as intended, go to the server directory and run npm start. Then go to the root directory, item-catalog, and run npm start.
