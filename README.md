# ItemCatalog
A MERN Stack application where users can add information -- name, price, and a short description, in this case -- about items they find on eBay, Amazon, etc. price and description. Other users can see the items' price, description and popularity amongst users of the app to hopefully aid in making informed decisions about which items to buy. Users can post items and like items that they have not posted. Users can only like an item once, however (i.e. a user cannot like an item 2+ times). The most popular items with the lowest price are the first items users will see upon logging in. Users are also granted a profile showing recent activity on the app such as most popular items, recently liked and posted items, and total number of liked and posted items.

In this branch, I have updated the server to have more efficient queries by filtering out unnecessary info for each request, bcrypt for encrypting password when a user is registered/updates the password, as well as changing how I run middleware in the authRoutes folder for deleting an account so that it doesn't always run the middleware when I navigate to the profile. I also removed all deprecation warnings from item-catalog when starting the react-app using npm start. 

So far, in terms of hosting, I got it running on Docker Desktop, but still have to publish it to Docker Hub. I plan to do that after correctly building the project in dbChanges branch.
