# ItemCatalog
A MERN Stack where users can add information about items on the market such as their price and description. Other users can see the items, their price and current rating to see which ones are more enticing to buy than others. Said users can also rate them using the star and minus buttons under the current rating. Users must login/register first. 

To run the program as intended, go to the server directory and run npm start. Then go to the root directory, item-catalog, and run npm start.
