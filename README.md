# ItemCatalog
Put a Price On It! is a modern MERN stack web application designed to help users make smarter purchasing decisions. Users can share information about items they find on platforms like eBay, Amazon, and more by adding an itemâ€™s name, price, and a brief description. The community can view these items, like their favorites, and assess their popularity. Key features include:

- Community-Driven Insights: Users can post items and like others' posts (but can only like each item once).
- Optimized Discoverability: Items are ranked and displayed based on popularity and affordability, ensuring the best value deals are highlighted first when users log in.
- Personalized Profiles: Each user has a profile showcasing their activity, including recently liked and posted items, the most popular items, and a summary of their total contributions (likes and posts).

This intuitive platform empowers users to make informed buying decisions by combining price visibility with community feedback.


My MERN Stack is currently [hosted on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/donoftime2018/item-catalog/general), and I have setup a CI/CD pipeline to update the client and server images on every merged request to the main branch.
